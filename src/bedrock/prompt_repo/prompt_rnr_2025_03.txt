        * Functionality problems
        * Quality below expectations
        * Authenticity concerns
    - Must include buyer confirmation of receiving item

Analysis Instructions:

Please analyze:
Dialogue: {dialogue}
Ship Track Events: {shiptrack}
Estimated Delivery: {max_estimated_arrival_date}

Provide your analysis in the following structured format:

1. Category: [Exactly one of: No_BSM, Buyer_Received_WrongORDefective_Item, In_Transit, Delivered_Post_EDD, TrueDNR, TrueNOTR, Seller_Unable_To_Ship, BuyerCancellation, ReturnRequested, AddressChangeRequest, Invoice, Price_Discount, NoConfirmationFromBSM]

2. Confidence Score: [Number between 0.00 and 1.00]

3. Key Evidence:
   * Message Evidence:
     [sep] [Quote or description of relevant message content]
     [sep] [Additional message evidence if available]
   * Shipping Evidence:
     [sep] [Relevant tracking events with timestamps]
     [sep] [Additional shipping evidence if available]
   * Timeline Evidence:
     [sep] [Chronological analysis of events]
     [sep] [Timing comparisons]

4. Reasoning:
   * Primary Factors:
     [sep] [Main reasons for classification]
     [sep] [Key decision points]
   * Supporting Evidence:
     [sep] [Additional evidence supporting the classification]
     [sep] [Corroborating details]
   * Contradicting Evidence:
     [sep] [Any evidence that conflicts with the classification]
     [sep] [Write "None" if no contradicting evidence exists]

Classification Rules:
- Choose exactly ONE category
- Provide confidence score as a decimal number (e.g., 0.95)
- List evidence as bullet points starting with "[sep]"
- Include specific quotes and timestamps where available
- Separate evidence types clearly under appropriate headers
- Ensure all sections are properly formatted for automated parsing
- Do NOT use semicolons (;) in the response
- Multiple pieces of evidence should be separated by [sep] token


Example Format:
3. Key Evidence:
   * Message Evidence: 
     [sep] [BUYER]: Hello, I have not received my package, but I see the order shows that it has been delivered, why?
     [sep] [BUYER]: But I did not find any package, please refund me, thank you
   * Shipping Evidence:
     [sep] [Event Time]: 2025-02-21T17:40:49.323Z [Ship Track Event]: Delivered to customer.
     [sep] No further shipping events after delivery confirmation
   * Timeline Evidence:
     [sep] Delivery confirmation on 2025-02-21 17:40 
     [sep] Buyer reports non-receipt starting 2025-02-25 07:14

4. Reasoning:
   * Primary Factors:
     [sep] Tracking shows package was delivered successfully
     [sep] Buyer explicitly states they did not receive the package after delivery scan
   * Supporting Evidence: 
     [sep] Buyer requests refund due to missing package
     [sep] No evidence of buyer receiving wrong/defective item
   * Contradicting Evidence:
     [sep] None
