# Pipeline Scripts Testability Report

## Summary

- **Total scripts tested:** 8 out of 8
- **Total tests run:** 72
- **Test result:** All tests passed successfully
- **Missing test coverage:** None

## Existing Test Structure

The current test structure follows a consistent pattern:
- Separate test classes for helper functions and main execution flows
- Tests use unittest framework with proper assertions
- Mocking is used for external dependencies (filesystem, environment variables)
- Test setup/teardown for test isolation
- Edge cases are covered

## Script-by-Script Analysis

### 1. currency_conversion.py
- **Test file:** test_currency_conversion.py
- **Test coverage:** Good
- **Test structure:** Well-organized with separate test classes for helpers and main execution
- **Mocking strategy:** Uses patch and MagicMock for filesystem and argparse
- **Notable tests:** Tests for edge cases like invalid currencies and disabled conversion

### 2. mims_package.py
- **Test file:** test_mims_package.py
- **Test coverage:** Good
- **Test structure:** Separate tests for helper functions and main flow
- **Mocking strategy:** Temporary directories and file operations mocking
- **Notable tests:** Tests for different input formats (direct files vs tar files)

### 3. mims_payload.py
- **Test file:** test_mims_payload.py
- **Test coverage:** Very good
- **Test structure:** Comprehensive tests for helpers and main flow
- **Mocking strategy:** Environment variables and filesystem mocking
- **Notable tests:** Tests for error conditions (missing files)

### 4. model_calibration.py
- **Test file:** test_model_calibration.py + test_model_calibration_integration.py
- **Test coverage:** Excellent
- **Test structure:** Unit tests and integration tests are separated
- **Mocking strategy:** Test data generation and filesystem mocking
- **Notable tests:** End-to-end workflow tests for different classification types

### 5. model_evaluation_xgb.py
- **Test file:** test_model_evaluation_xgb.py
- **Test coverage:** Good
- **Test structure:** Well-organized test cases
- **Mocking strategy:** Test data and model artifact generation
- **Notable tests:** Tests for metrics computation in different scenarios

### 6. risk_table_mapping.py
- **Test file:** test_risk_table_mapping.py
- **Test coverage:** Good
- **Test structure:** Tests for both class functionality and main flow
- **Mocking strategy:** Test data generation
- **Notable tests:** Tests for categorical value mapping

### 7. tabular_preprocess.py
- **Test file:** test_tabular_preprocess.py
- **Test coverage:** Good
- **Test structure:** Tests for helpers and main function
- **Mocking strategy:** Temporary directories and test data generation
- **Notable tests:** Tests for different job types and error conditions

### 8. contract_utils.py
- **Test file:** None (as specified by user)
- **Reason:** This is a utility module with helper functions for contract validation

### 9. dummy_training.py
- **Test file:** test_dummy_training.py
- **Test coverage:** Good
- **Test structure:** Separate test classes for helper functions and main flow
- **Mocking strategy:** Temporary directories for file operations and mocked Path objects
- **Notable tests:** Tests for error handling and different execution paths

## Testability Recommendations

2. **General improvements for all scripts**:
   - Consider using more parameterized tests for similar test cases
   - Add more comments explaining test strategies
   - Consider adding property-based testing for complex data transformations

## Testing Best Practices Observed

1. **Function Isolation**: Most scripts have well-isolated functions that are easier to test
2. **Dependency Injection**: Parameters are passed explicitly rather than using globals
3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling makes testing edge cases possible
4. **Test Data Generation**: Test data is properly set up and isolated
5. **Mocking External Dependencies**: External dependencies are properly mocked

## Conclusion

The pipeline scripts demonstrate good testability with well-structured code and comprehensive tests. All scripts now have corresponding test files that follow good practices and provide thorough coverage of functionality. The test implementation for `dummy_training.py` follows the established pattern of testing both helper functions and the main execution flow with appropriate mocking strategies.
