# Training Pipeline Alignment Project Status
**Date:** July 6, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETED  
**Scope:** XGBoost and PyTorch Training Pipeline Alignment

## Project Overview

This project focused on achieving perfect alignment between training scripts, their contracts, and step specifications for both XGBoost and PyTorch training frameworks. The goal was to ensure that the contract serves as the single source of truth that both the actual script implementation and the pipeline specification conform to.

## Unified Architecture Pattern

Both training frameworks now follow a consistent pattern:

### Input Structure
```
input_path: "/opt/ml/input/data"  # Parent directory containing:
  ├── train/                      # Training data files
  ├── val/                        # Validation data files
  └── test/                       # Test data files
config: "/opt/ml/input/config/hyperparameters.json"
```

### Output Structure
```
model_output: "/opt/ml/model"           # Trained model artifacts
evaluation_output: "/opt/ml/output/data" # Evaluation results (XGBoost)
data_output: "/opt/ml/output/data"      # Training outputs (PyTorch)
checkpoints: "/opt/ml/checkpoints"      # Training checkpoints (PyTorch only)
```

### Specification Pattern
- **2 Dependencies:** `input_path` (required), `config`/`hyperparameters_s3_uri` (required/optional)
- **4-5 Outputs:** Consolidated using aliases for backward compatibility
- **Contract Reference:** Built-in validation mechanism
- **Comprehensive Tests:** 10+ test cases per specification

# Example: XGBoost model_output aliases
aliases=["ModelOutputPath", "ModelArtifacts", "model_data", "output_path", "model_input"]
```

### 3. Comprehensive Validation Framework
```python
result = TRAINING_SPEC.validate_contract_alignment()
# Automatically checks all inputs/outputs match
```

### 4. Unified Testing Pattern

## Conclusion

The Training Pipeline Alignment Project has successfully achieved its primary objectives:

1. **Perfect Alignment:** Both XGBoost and PyTorch training components now have 100% alignment between scripts, contracts, and specifications.

2. **Unified Architecture:** Consistent patterns across frameworks enable easier maintenance and extension.

3. **Quality Foundation:** Comprehensive testing and validation frameworks prevent future alignment drift.

4. **Scalable Design:** The established patterns can be easily applied to additional training frameworks.

This work provides a solid foundation for reliable, maintainable training pipelines and serves as a template for future ML pipeline component development. The contract-driven approach ensures that the pipeline specifications accurately reflect the actual script behavior, eliminating a major source of runtime errors and configuration mismatches.
