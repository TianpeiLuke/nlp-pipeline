## Updated XGBoost Pipeline Components

### Step Specifications (All Complete)

All required specifications have been implemented and tested:

```python
# Processing step specifications
DATA_LOADING_SPEC = StepSpecification(...)
PREPROCESSING_SPEC = StepSpecification(...)
MODEL_EVAL_SPEC = StepSpecification(...)
CURRENCY_CONVERSION_SPEC = StepSpecification(...)

# Training step specifications
XGBOOST_TRAINING_SPEC = StepSpecification(...)
PYTORCH_TRAINING_SPEC = StepSpecification(...)

# Model step specifications
XGBOOST_MODEL_SPEC = StepSpecification(...)
PYTORCH_MODEL_SPEC = StepSpecification(...)

# Registration step specifications
REGISTRATION_SPEC = StepSpecification(...)
```

### Script Contracts (All Complete)

Script contracts have been implemented for all steps:

```python
# Processing script contracts
CRADLE_DATA_LOADING_CONTRACT = ScriptContract(...)
TABULAR_PREPROCESSING_CONTRACT = ScriptContract(...)
MODEL_EVAL_CONTRACT = ScriptContract(...)
CURRENCY_CONVERSION_CONTRACT = ScriptContract(...)

# Training script contracts
XGBOOST_TRAIN_CONTRACT = ScriptContract(...)
PYTORCH_TRAIN_CONTRACT = ScriptContract(...)

# Model script contracts
XGBOOST_MODEL_CONTRACT = ScriptContract(...)
PYTORCH_MODEL_CONTRACT = ScriptContract(...)

# Registration script contract
REGISTRATION_CONTRACT = ScriptContract(...)
```

### Step Builders (All Updated)

All step builders have been updated to use the specification-driven approach:

```python
# Example of updated builder pattern
class XGBoostTrainingStepBuilder(StepBuilderBase):
    def __init__(self, config, sagemaker_session=None, role=None, notebook_root=None):
        # Load specification
        if not SPEC_AVAILABLE or XGBOOST_TRAINING_SPEC is None:
            raise ValueError("XGBoost training specification not available")
            
        super().__init__(
            config=config,
            spec=XGBOOST_TRAINING_SPEC,  # Add specification
            sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,
            role=role,
            notebook_root=notebook_root
        )
        self.config: XGBoostTrainingConfig = config
        
    def _get_inputs(self, inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, TrainingInput]:
        """Use specification dependencies to get training inputs"""
        # Implementation using spec and contract
        
    def _get_outputs(self, outputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Use specification outputs to get output path"""
        # Implementation using spec and contract
```

### Unified Dependency Resolution

All step builders now use the `UnifiedDependencyResolver` to extract inputs from dependencies:

```python
def create_step(self, **kwargs) -> Step:
    """Create step with automatic dependency resolution"""
    # Extract inputs from dependencies using resolver
    dependencies = kwargs.get('dependencies', [])
    extracted_inputs = self.extract_inputs_from_dependencies(dependencies)
    
    # Process inputs and create step
    inputs = self._get_inputs(extracted_inputs)
    outputs = self._get_outputs({})
    
    # Create and return step
    step = CreateStep(...)
    setattr(step, '_spec', self.spec)  # Attach spec for future reference
    return step
```

### Job Type Variant Handling (Solved)

The job type variant issue has been solved using two complementary approaches:

1. **Job Type-Specific Specifications** (NEW):
   - Created dedicated specifications for each job type:
     - `data_loading_training_spec.py` - Training data specification
     - `data_loading_calibration_spec.py` - Calibration data specification
     - `data_loading_validation_spec.py` - Validation data specification
     - `data_loading_testing_spec.py` - Testing data specification
   - Each specification contains properly defined outputs with appropriate semantic keywords
   - CradleDataLoadingStepBuilder now dynamically selects the correct specification based on job type

2. **Environment Variable-Based Contract Enforcement**:
   - Script contracts validate required environment variables at runtime
   - Scripts check job type and adjust behavior accordingly
   - Builders set appropriate environment variables
   - Contract paths are respected based on job type

The combination of these approaches provides a robust solution for handling job type variants while maintaining specification-driven architecture.

### Recent Infrastructure Improvements

Recent infrastructure improvements have significantly enhanced the stability and flexibility of the pipeline system:

#### 1. Enum Hashability Fix

As documented in [Remove Global Singletons](./2025-07-08_remove_global_singletons.md), the DependencyType and NodeType enums in base_specifications.py were causing errors when used as dictionary keys:

```
TypeError: unhashable type: 'DependencyType'
```

This was fixed by adding proper `__hash__` methods to both enum classes:

```python
def __hash__(self):
    """Ensure hashability is maintained when used as dictionary keys."""
    return hash(self.value)
```

The root cause was that Python automatically makes classes unhashable if they override `__eq__` without also defining `__hash__`. This fix ensures that:
- DependencyType can be properly used as dictionary keys in compatibility matrices
- Hash values are consistent with the equality behavior (objects that compare equal have the same hash)
- Both enums follow the same pattern for maintainability

#### 2. Job Type-Specific Specifications

Created dedicated specifications for all data loading job types:
- `data_loading_calibration_spec.py`
- `data_loading_validation_spec.py` 
- `data_loading_testing_spec.py`

This prevents errors like `'str' object has no attribute 'logical_name'` that were occurring due to improperly structured specifications.

#### 3. Abstract Pipeline Template

Implemented `AbstractPipelineTemplate` class to provide a consistent foundation for all pipeline templates. This reduces code duplication across templates and enforces a standard approach to pipeline generation.

### Dependency Injection Approach

Following the [Remove Global Singletons](./2025-07-08_remove_global_singletons.md) plan, the enhanced pipeline builder now uses dependency injection instead of global singletons:

```python
class SpecificationEnhancedXGBoostPipelineBuilder:
    """
    Enhanced pipeline builder that uses specifications for dependency resolution
    while leveraging the modernized step builders and dependency injection.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, config_path: str, sagemaker_session=None, role=None, 
                 registry_manager=None, semantic_matcher=None, dependency_resolver=None):
        # Load existing configs
        self.configs = load_configs(config_path, CONFIG_CLASSES)
        
        # Use injected dependencies or create new instances
        self.registry_manager = registry_manager or RegistryManager()
        self.registry = self.registry_manager.get_registry("xgboost_pipeline")
        self.semantic_matcher = semantic_matcher or SemanticMatcher()
        
        # Create resolver if not provided
        if dependency_resolver is None:
            self.dependency_resolver = UnifiedDependencyResolver(
                registry=self.registry, 
                semantic_matcher=self.semantic_matcher
            )
        else:
            self.dependency_resolver = dependency_resolver
        
        # Create step builders with dependencies injected
        self._create_step_builders()
```
