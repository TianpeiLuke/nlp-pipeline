## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Derived configurations produce incorrect results | Medium | High | Extensive validation tests comparing derived vs. manually created configurations |
| Users find feature groups too restrictive | Medium | Medium | Provide custom field options and advanced configuration overrides |
| Adoption resistance due to familiarity with old approach | High | Medium | Clear documentation, workshops, and highlighting time savings |
| Integration issues with existing pipeline components | Medium | High | Thorough integration testing and maintaining format compatibility |
| Performance issues with large configurations | Low | Medium | Optimization of derivation logic and caching strategies |

5. **Configuration Sharing and Collaboration**: Enable team collaboration on configurations

## Conclusion

The Essential Inputs implementation offers a significant opportunity to improve the user experience of pipeline configuration. By focusing on the three essential areas of input and automating everything else, we can dramatically reduce the time and effort required to configure pipelines while improving accuracy and consistency.

The phased implementation approach allows for careful development and testing, followed by a gradual rollout that ensures users can transition smoothly to the new system. With proper attention to backward compatibility and user education, this project can deliver substantial benefits to all users of the XGBoost evaluation pipeline.
