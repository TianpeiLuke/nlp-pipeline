# Removing Global Singleton Objects

**Date:** July 12, 2025 (Updated)  
**Status:** 🔄 IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS - 85% Complete  
**Priority:** 🔥 HIGH - Foundation for Testing Reliability

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to remove global singleton objects from the pipeline dependencies system. This change will significantly improve testability, debugging, and concurrent execution by eliminating unwanted correlations between different parts of the codebase. The plan involves a phased approach to minimize disruption while ensuring comprehensive refactoring of all affected components.

## Current Issues with Global Singletons

As documented in [global_vs_local_objects.md](../pipeline_design/global_vs_local_objects.md), the current architecture has several pain points:

1. **Testing Challenges**
   - Tests that pass individually may fail when run together due to shared state
   - Requires complex setUp/tearDown cleanup methods
   - Test isolation issues lead to inconsistent results

2. **Developer Coordination Issues**
   - Unwanted correlation between different developers' work
   - Changes in one area can unexpectedly impact another
   - Difficult to debug issues with shared global state

3. **Concurrency Limitations**
   - Potential race conditions in multi-threaded environments
   - Need for synchronization creates bottlenecks
   - Difficulty in parallel execution

4. **Hidden Dependencies**
   - Function dependencies not explicit in signatures
   - "Spooky action at a distance" where changes in one part affect another
   - Complex dependency graph that's difficult to understand

## Identified Global Singletons

The codebase currently uses three primary global singleton objects that need to be refactored:

1. **Registry Manager**:
   - Global instance: `registry_manager` in `registry_manager.py`
   - Used for managing multiple isolated specification registries
   - Used via convenience functions like `get_registry()`

2. **Dependency Resolver**:
   - Global instance: `global_resolver` in `dependency_resolver.py`
   - Used for resolving dependencies between steps
   - Maintains resolution cache for performance

3. **Semantic Matcher**:
   - Global instance: `semantic_matcher` in `semantic_matcher.py`
   - Used for calculating semantic similarity between names
   - Contains predefined synonym dictionaries and matching algorithms

## Component Relationships

These components have the following dependencies:

```
SemanticMatcher <-- UnifiedDependencyResolver <-- StepBuilderBase
                                              ^
                                              |
SpecificationRegistry <---------------------->+
         ^
         |
RegistryManager
```

The migration needs to respect these relationships by ensuring that components higher in the dependency chain are updated first.

- ✅ Implemented factory functions for creating properly configured components
- ✅ Added convenience methods for common use cases
- ✅ Included comprehensive documentation and examples

The implementation provides a centralized factory function that creates all dependency components with proper wiring:

```python
def create_pipeline_components(context_name=None):
    """Create all necessary pipeline components with proper dependencies."""
    semantic_matcher = SemanticMatcher()
    registry_manager = RegistryManager()
    registry = registry_manager.get_registry(context_name or "default")
    resolver = UnifiedDependencyResolver(registry, semantic_matcher)
    
    return {
        "semantic_matcher": semantic_matcher,
        "registry_manager": registry_manager,
        "registry": registry,
        "resolver": resolver
    }
```

#### 2.2 Update Step Builder Base Class - ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Modified `StepBuilderBase` constructor to accept necessary dependencies:

```python
def __init__(self, config, spec=None, sagemaker_session=None, role=None,
             notebook_root=None, registry_manager=None, dependency_resolver=None):
    # ...
    self._registry_manager = registry_manager
    self._dependency_resolver = dependency_resolver
    # ...
```

- ✅ Added helper methods for creating or getting dependencies:

```python
def _get_context_name(self) -> str:
    """Get the context name to use for registry operations."""
    if hasattr(self.config, 'pipeline_name') and self.config.pipeline_name:
        return self.config.pipeline_name
    return "default"

def _get_registry_manager(self) -> RegistryManager:
    """Get or create a registry manager."""
    if not hasattr(self, '_registry_manager') or self._registry_manager is None:
        self._registry_manager = RegistryManager()
        self.log_debug("Created new registry manager")
    return self._registry_manager

def _get_registry(self):
    """Get the appropriate registry for this step."""
    registry_manager = self._get_registry_manager()
    context_name = self._get_context_name()
    return registry_manager.get_registry(context_name)

def _get_dependency_resolver(self) -> UnifiedDependencyResolver:
    """Get or create a dependency resolver."""
    if not hasattr(self, '_dependency_resolver') or self._dependency_resolver is None:
        registry = self._get_registry()
        semantic_matcher = SemanticMatcher()
        self._dependency_resolver = create_dependency_resolver(registry, semantic_matcher)
        self.log_debug(f"Created new dependency resolver for context '{self._get_context_name()}'")
    return self._dependency_resolver
```

- ✅ Updated `extract_inputs_from_dependencies` method to use the injected or lazily created resolver:

```python
def extract_inputs_from_dependencies(self, dependency_steps: List[Step]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ...
    # Use the injected resolver or create one
    resolver = self._get_dependency_resolver()
    resolver.register_specification(step_name, self.spec)
    # ...
```

#### 2.3 Add Context Management - ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Implemented context managers for scoped component usage:

```python
@contextmanager
def dependency_resolution_context(clear_on_exit=True):
    """Create a scoped dependency resolution context."""
    components = create_pipeline_components()
    try:
        yield components
    finally:
        if clear_on_exit:
            components["resolver"].clear_cache()
            components["registry_manager"].clear_all_contexts()
```

#### 2.4 Add Thread-Local Storage - ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Implemented thread-local storage for per-thread component instances:

```python
# Thread-local storage for per-thread instances
_thread_local = threading.local()

def get_thread_components():
    """Get thread-specific component instances."""
    if not hasattr(_thread_local, 'components'):
        _thread_local.components = create_pipeline_components()
    return _thread_local.components
```

### Phase 3: Application Updates (Week 3) - ✅ COMPLETED

#### 3.1 Update Pipeline Builder Classes - ✅ COMPLETED

This phase focuses on updating all pipeline builder classes to use the new dependency injection pattern instead of global singletons.

##### Required Changes

1. **Constructor Modifications**:
   - ✅ Update all pipeline builder constructors to accept registry_manager and dependency_resolver parameters
   - ✅ Implement proper default creation with factory methods when parameters are not provided
   
   ```python
   class PipelineBuilderBase:
       def __init__(self, config, registry_manager=None, dependency_resolver=None):
           self.config = config
           
           # Use injected or create new registry manager
           self.registry_manager = registry_manager or RegistryManager()
           
           # Get registry for this pipeline
           context_name = getattr(config, 'pipeline_name', 'default_pipeline')
           self.registry = self.registry_manager.get_registry(context_name)
           
           # Create resolver if not provided
           if dependency_resolver is None:
               from ..pipeline_deps.factory import create_dependency_resolver
               semantic_matcher = SemanticMatcher()
               dependency_resolver = create_dependency_resolver(self.registry, semantic_matcher)
           self.dependency_resolver = dependency_resolver
   ```

2. **Builder Factory Methods**:
   - ✅ Add factory methods that use the component factory for pipeline builders:

   ```python
   @classmethod
   def create_with_components(cls, config, context_name=None):
       """Create pipeline builder with managed components."""
       components = create_pipeline_components(context_name)
       return cls(
           config=config,
           registry_manager=components["registry_manager"],
           dependency_resolver=components["resolver"]
       )
   ```

3. **Component Passing**:
   - ✅ Update all methods that create step builders to pass the components:

   ```python
   def create_training_step(self, **kwargs):
       """Create training step with properly configured components."""
       training_builder = TrainingStepBuilder(
           config=self.config.training,
           registry_manager=self.registry_manager,
           dependency_resolver=self.dependency_resolver,
           **kwargs
       )
       return training_builder.create_step()
   ```

#### 3.2 Update Step Builder Implementations - ✅ COMPLETED

This phase focuses on updating all step builder classes to properly support dependency injection and use the new helper methods in StepBuilderBase.

##### Required Changes

1. **Constructor Updates**:
   - ✅ Update all step builder constructors to accept and forward registry_manager and dependency_resolver parameters:

   ```python
   class ProcessingStepBuilder(StepBuilderBase):
       def __init__(
           self,
           config,
           spec=None, 
           sagemaker_session=None,
           role=None,
           notebook_root=None,
           registry_manager=None,      # New parameter
           dependency_resolver=None    # New parameter
       ):
           super().__init__(
               config=config,
               spec=spec,
               sagemaker_session=sagemaker_session,
               role=role,
               notebook_root=notebook_root,
               registry_manager=registry_manager,        # Pass to parent
               dependency_resolver=dependency_resolver   # Pass to parent
           )
   ```

2. **Replace Direct Global References**:
   - ✅ Remove any code that directly imports or uses global singletons
   - ✅ Replace with calls to the new helper methods:
     - `self._get_dependency_resolver()`
     - `self._get_registry_manager()`
     - `self._get_registry()`

   Before:
   ```python
   from ..pipeline_deps.dependency_resolver import global_resolver
   
   # ...
   
   def resolve_dependencies(self, steps):
       resolver = global_resolver
       resolver.register_specification(...)
   ```

   After:
   ```python
   def resolve_dependencies(self, steps):
       resolver = self._get_dependency_resolver()
       resolver.register_specification(...)
   ```

3. **Update Registry Access**:
   - ✅ Replace direct registry access with context-aware methods

   Before:
   ```python
   from ..pipeline_deps.registry_manager import get_registry
   
   # ...
   
   registry = get_registry("some_context")
   ```

   After:
   ```python
   registry = self._get_registry()  # Gets registry for appropriate context
   ```

#### 3.3 Update Pipeline Examples - ✅ COMPLETED

This phase focuses on updating example pipeline scripts to demonstrate proper component creation and dependency injection.

##### Required Changes

1. **Component Creation**:
   - ✅ Update pipeline examples to use the factory module for component creation:

   ```python
   from src.v2.pipeline_deps.factory import create_pipeline_components
   
   def build_pipeline():
       # Create components for this pipeline context
       components = create_pipeline_components("example_pipeline")
       
       # Create pipeline builder with components
       pipeline_builder = ExamplePipelineBuilder(
           config=config,
           registry_manager=components["registry_manager"],
           dependency_resolver=components["resolver"]
       )
       
       # Use the pipeline builder to create the pipeline
       pipeline = pipeline_builder.build()
       return pipeline
   ```

2. **Context Manager Usage**:
   - ✅ Add examples of using context managers for scoped component usage:

   ```python
   from src.v2.pipeline_deps.factory import dependency_resolution_context
   
   def run_pipeline_example():
       with dependency_resolution_context(clear_on_exit=True) as components:
           # Create pipeline builder with scoped components
           pipeline_builder = ExamplePipelineBuilder(
               config=config,
               registry_manager=components["registry_manager"],
               dependency_resolver=components["resolver"]
           )
           
           # Use the pipeline builder to create and run the pipeline
           pipeline = pipeline_builder.build()
           pipeline.run()
           # Components automatically cleaned up when context exits
   ```

3. **Thread Safety Examples**:
   - ✅ Add examples showing how to use thread-local storage for thread-safe pipelines:

   ```python
   from src.v2.pipeline_deps.factory import get_thread_components
   import threading
   
   def run_in_thread():
       # Each thread gets its own isolated components
       components = get_thread_components()
       
       # Create pipeline builder with thread-local components
       pipeline_builder = ExamplePipelineBuilder(
           config=config,
           registry_manager=components["registry_manager"],
           dependency_resolver=components["resolver"]
       )
       
       # Use the pipeline builder to create and run the pipeline
       pipeline = pipeline_builder.build()
       pipeline.run()
   
   # Create and start threads for concurrent execution
   threads = []
   for i in range(3):
       thread = threading.Thread(target=run_in_thread)
       threads.append(thread)
       thread.start()
   
   # Wait for all threads to complete
   for thread in threads:
       thread.join()
   ```

4. **Best Practices Documentation**:

All major template types have been successfully tested end-to-end using the new dependency injection approach:

- **XGBoostTrainEvaluateE2ETemplate**: Full pipeline with training, evaluation, and registration
  - Verified dependency resolution works correctly across all steps
  - Confirmed property references are properly propagated
  - Validated execution document support
  - Tested with multiple configurations

  - Verified proper DAG structure without registration step
  - Confirmed pipeline executes correctly with partial step set

- **XGBoostSimpleTemplate**: Basic training pipeline
  - Verified minimal step configuration works correctly
  - Confirmed template is resilient to missing optional steps

  - Verified the most basic pipeline configuration works
  - Confirmed job type handling for isolated data loading steps

### 2. MIMS Payload Path Handling Fix

A critical fix was implemented for path handling in the MIMS payload step:

- Fixed issue where the payload script was trying to create a file at `/opt/ml/processing/output/payload.tar.gz` but SageMaker created a directory at that path
- Updated the script contract to specify a directory path (`/opt/ml/processing/output`) instead of a file path
- Modified builder to generate S3 paths without the file suffix
- Confirmed the solution works with the MIMS registration validation

See [MIMS Payload Path Handling Fix](./2025-07-12_mims_payload_path_handling_fix.md) for full details.

### 3. Thread Safety Improvements

- Enhanced thread safety throughout the dependency components
- Properly isolated registry contexts to prevent cross-thread contamination
- Added thread-local storage pattern for per-thread component instances
- Verified through concurrent pipeline execution tests

## Key Design Patterns

### Factory Method Pattern

```python
def create_dependency_resolver(registry=None, semantic_matcher=None):
    """Factory method for creating a properly configured dependency resolver."""
    registry = registry or SpecificationRegistry()
    semantic_matcher = semantic_matcher or SemanticMatcher()
    return UnifiedDependencyResolver(registry, semantic_matcher)
```

### Dependency Injection Pattern

```python
class StepBuilder:
    def __init__(self, config, dependency_resolver=None):
        self.config = config
        self.dependency_resolver = dependency_resolver or create_dependency_resolver()
        
    def resolve_dependencies(self, dependencies):
        # Use the injected dependency resolver
        return self.dependency_resolver.resolve_step_dependencies(...)
```

### Context Manager Pattern

```python
with dependency_resolution_context() as components:
    resolver = components["resolver"]
    result = resolver.resolve_step_dependencies(...)
    # Automatically cleans up when context exits
```

### Thread-Local Storage Pattern

```python
def get_current_components():
    """Get thread-specific component instances."""
    if not hasattr(_thread_local, 'components'):
        _thread_local.components = create_pipeline_components()
    return _thread_local.components
```

## Special Path Handling for Model Evaluation

The recent improvements to script path resolution revealed inconsistencies in how different step types handle path resolution. Specifically, we identified and fixed a special case with the XGBoost Model Evaluation step:

1. **Path Resolution Issue**:
   - The `XGBoostModelEvalStepBuilder` expects to receive the entry point name and source directory separately
   - However, the `get_script_path()` method was combining these into a single path
   - This inconsistency caused errors when the pipeline was executed

2. **Implementation Solution**:
   - Modified `get_script_path()` in `XGBoostModelEvalConfig` to return only the entry point name without combining with source directory
   - Updated the builder code to explicitly document this special case
   - Created comprehensive documentation in `model_evaluation_path_handling.md` to explain the design decision

3. **Key Benefits**:
   - Fixed pipeline execution errors without requiring changes to multiple components
   - Preserved backward compatibility with existing code
   - Added clear documentation to prevent future confusion
   - Implemented the least invasive solution to minimize risk

This change demonstrates our commitment to maintaining backward compatibility while addressing technical debt. The solution follows the principle of least surprise and provides a clear path forward for future path handling standardization.

## Progress Summary as of July 12, 2025

### Pipeline Dependencies Modernization

Today we completed significant additional updates to the pipeline dependency system:

1. **Successfully Tested All Template Types**:
   - ✅ **XGBoostTrainEvaluateE2ETemplate**: Complete end-to-end pipeline with registration
   - ✅ **XGBoostTrainEvaluateNoRegistrationTemplate**: Training and evaluation without registration
   - ✅ **XGBoostSimpleTemplate**: Basic training pipeline
   - ✅ **XGBoostDataloadPreprocessTemplate**: Data loading and preprocessing only
   - ✅ **CradleOnlyTemplate**: Cradle data loading components only

2. **MIMS Payload Path Handling Fix**:
   - Fixed error in payload script that was trying to write to a directory as a file
   - Updated script contract to use a directory path instead of a file path
   - Modified builder to generate appropriate S3 paths
   - Full details in [MIMS Payload Path Handling Fix](./2025-07-12_mims_payload_path_handling_fix.md)

3. **Thread Safety Improvements**:
   - Enhanced thread safety throughout the dependency components
   - Properly isolated registry contexts to prevent cross-thread contamination
   - Added thread-local storage pattern for per-thread component instances
   - Verified through concurrent pipeline execution tests

4. **Testing Framework Enhancements**:
   - Created dedicated test helpers for isolation testing
   - Updated core component tests to use the isolation pattern
   - Added verification to ensure no state leakage between tests
   - Extended test coverage to include factory methods

5. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated API documentation across all refactored components
   - Created comprehensive migration guide with examples
   - Added best practices documentation for dependency injection
   - Included thread safety considerations and patterns

The implementation has met all key objectives and has been successfully tested across multiple template types. Remaining tasks are focused on completing documentation, finalizing tests, and performing final cleanup.
