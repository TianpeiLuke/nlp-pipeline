# Phase 2: Contract Key Alignment Summary
*Date: July 5, 2025*

## Overview
This document summarizes the contract key alignment fixes applied in Phase 2 to ensure that script contract keys match the logical names in step specifications.

## Problem Identified
Several script contracts had misaligned keys where the contract's expected input/output paths didn't match the logical names defined in the corresponding step specifications. This created inconsistencies that could lead to runtime failures during pipeline execution.

## Alignment Principle
The correct alignment logic is:
- **Specs can provide more inputs than contracts require** (extra dependencies allowed)
- **Contracts can have fewer outputs than specs provide** (aliases allowed)
- **For every contract input, there must be a matching spec dependency**
- **For every contract output, there must be a matching spec output**

## Files Fixed

### 1. Tabular Preprocessing Contract
**File**: `src/pipeline_script_contracts/tabular_preprocess_contract.py`

**Issues Found**:
- Contract only defined `DATA` input, but spec expected `DATA`, `METADATA`, `SIGNATURE`
- Contract only defined `processed_data` output, but spec expected `processed_data`, `full_data`

**Fixes Applied**:
```python
# Before
expected_input_paths={
    "DATA": "/opt/ml/processing/input/data",
},
expected_output_paths={
    "processed_data": "/opt/ml/processing/output"
}

# After
expected_input_paths={
    "DATA": "/opt/ml/processing/input/data",
    "METADATA": "/opt/ml/processing/input/metadata",
    "SIGNATURE": "/opt/ml/processing/input/signature"
},
expected_output_paths={
    "processed_data": "/opt/ml/processing/output",
    "full_data": "/opt/ml/processing/output/full"
}
```

### 2. XGBoost Training Contract
**File**: `src/pipeline_script_contracts/xgboost_train_contract.py`

**Issues Found**:
- Contract used `train_data`, `val_data`, `test_data`, `config` but spec expected `input_path`, `hyperparameters_s3_uri`
- Contract used `model_output`, `data_output` but spec expected `model_output` only

**Fixes Applied**:
```python
# Before
expected_input_paths={
    "train_data": "/opt/ml/input/data/train",
    "val_data": "/opt/ml/input/data/val",
    "test_data": "/opt/ml/input/data/test",
    "config": "/opt/ml/input/data/config/hyperparameters.json"
},
expected_output_paths={
    "model_output": "/opt/ml/model",
    "data_output": "/opt/ml/output/data"
}

# After
expected_input_paths={
    "input_path": "/opt/ml/input/data",
    "hyperparameters_s3_uri": "/opt/ml/input/data/config/hyperparameters.json"
},
expected_output_paths={
    "model_output": "/opt/ml/model"
}
```

### 3. Model Evaluation Contract
**File**: `src/pipeline_script_contracts/model_evaluation_contract.py`

**Status**: Already aligned correctly
- Contract inputs: `model_input`, `eval_data_input` ✅
- Contract outputs: `eval_output`, `metrics_output` ✅
- Matches specification expectations perfectly

## Validation Logic Update

### Updated Validation Method
**File**: `src/pipeline_deps/base_specifications.py`

**Problem**: Original validation was too strict, requiring exact 1:1 matching
**Solution**: Updated `validate_contract_alignment()` method with flexible logic:

```python
def validate_contract_alignment(self) -> 'ValidationResult':
    """
    This validation logic:
    - Specs can provide more inputs than contracts require (extra dependencies allowed)
    - Contracts can have fewer outputs than specs provide (aliases allowed)
    - For every contract input, there must be a matching spec dependency
    - For every contract output, there must be a matching spec output
    """
    
    # Validate input alignment: every contract input must have a matching spec dependency
    contract_inputs = set(self.script_contract.expected_input_paths.keys())
    spec_dependency_names = set(dep.logical_name for dep in self.dependencies.values())
    
    missing_spec_dependencies = contract_inputs - spec_dependency_names
    if missing_spec_dependencies:
        errors.append(f"Contract inputs missing from specification dependencies: {missing_spec_dependencies}")
    
    # Validate output alignment: every contract output must have a matching spec output
    contract_outputs = set(self.script_contract.expected_output_paths.keys())
    spec_output_names = set(output.logical_name for output in self.outputs.values())
    
    missing_spec_outputs = contract_outputs - spec_output_names
    if missing_spec_outputs:
        errors.append(f"Contract outputs missing from specification outputs: {missing_spec_outputs}")
```

## Key Architectural Insights

### 1. Contract-Spec Relationship
- **Contracts define the minimum required interface** for scripts
- **Specifications can be more comprehensive** with aliases and optional dependencies
- **Validation ensures contracts are satisfied** by specifications

### 2. Flexibility Design
- **Input Flexibility**: Specs can define optional dependencies that contracts don't require
- **Output Flexibility**: Specs can define aliases that point to the same contract outputs
- **Validation Focus**: Ensure every contract requirement is met by the specification

### 3. Runtime Safety
- **Property Path Consistency**: Logical names match property path keys (Phase 1)
- **Contract Key Alignment**: Contract keys match specification logical names (Phase 2)
- **End-to-End Validation**: Complete alignment from specification to runtime execution

## Validation Results
After applying all fixes, the contract validation suite passes completely:
```
🎉 ALL CONTRACTS VALIDATED SUCCESSFULLY
   All specifications align with their contracts
🎯 VALIDATION SUITE PASSED
   Ready for deployment!
```

## Impact of Phase 2 Fixes

### 1. Runtime Consistency
- Contract keys now match specification logical names exactly
- Step builders can reliably map between specs and contracts
- No more runtime failures due to key mismatches

### 2. Maintainability
- Clear, consistent naming patterns across contracts and specifications
- Easier to understand the relationship between components
- Reduced debugging time for integration issues

### 3. Flexibility
- Specifications can evolve with aliases without breaking contracts
- Contracts remain focused on actual script requirements
- Validation catches misalignments early in development

### 4. Developer Experience
- Clear error messages when alignments are broken
- Automated validation prevents deployment of misaligned code
- Consistent patterns across all pipeline components

## Prevention Strategy
To prevent future contract key misalignments:

1. **Automated Validation**: Run `tools/validate_contracts.py` before any deployment
2. **Development Guidelines**: Always ensure contract keys match specification logical names
3. **Code Reviews**: Verify alignment when adding new contracts or specifications
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Include contract validation in automated testing pipeline

## Next Steps
Phase 2 is now complete. The system has:
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Property path consistency (logical names match property paths)
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Contract key alignment (contract keys match spec logical names)

Ready for Phase 3: Enhanced validation and spec-driven step builders.
