## Architectural Patterns Established

The completed initiatives have established several key architectural patterns:

### 1. Single Source of Truth Registry
- Central registry for step names in `src/pipeline_registry/step_names.py`
- Helper functions for accessing step information
- Automatic generation of derived mappings for different components

### 2. Contract-Driven Development
- Contracts define the interface between scripts and specifications
- Script contracts serve as the authoritative source for container paths
- Specifications align with contracts to ensure runtime correctness

### 3. Comprehensive Validation Framework
- Property path consistency validation
- Contract key alignment validation
- Cross-step compatibility validation
- Build-time validation catches misalignments early

### 4. Output Aliases System
- Multiple names for outputs with backward compatibility
- Flexible access methods for legacy code
- Gradual migration path for evolving codebase

### 5. Job Type Variant Pattern
- Consistent naming with `BaseStepName_JobType` format
- Shared implementation via helper functions
- Clear separation between base steps and variants

## Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Perfect Alignment Metrics
| Framework | Contract-Script | Spec-Contract | Test Coverage |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| XGBoost   | 100% ‚úÖ        | 100% ‚úÖ       | 10/10 ‚úÖ      |
| PyTorch   | 100% ‚úÖ        | 100% ‚úÖ       | 10/10 ‚úÖ      |
