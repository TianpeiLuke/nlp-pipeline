## Executive Summary

The Specification-Driven Pipeline Architecture project has made outstanding progress, achieving 98% completion as of July 12, 2025. All major architectural components are now implemented, tested, and integrated. The project has delivered on its key promises, including specification-driven step builders, unified dependency resolution, enhanced property references, template-based pipeline construction, and job type variant support.

The implementation has exceeded expectations in terms of code reduction, with approximately 1650 lines of complex code eliminated across step builders. The new architecture provides a robust foundation for future pipeline development while maintaining backward compatibility with existing pipelines.

**Latest Achievement**: Successfully completed end-to-end testing of all major pipeline template types: XGBoostTrainEvaluateE2ETemplate, XGBoostTrainEvaluateNoRegistrationTemplate, XGBoostSimpleTemplate, XGBoostDataloadPreprocessTemplate, and CradleOnlyTemplate. Also resolved a critical issue with MIMS payload path handling that improves robustness in the payload and registration steps.
