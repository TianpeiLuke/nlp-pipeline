# Registry as Single Source of Truth

## Overview

This document describes the design and implementation of the registry pattern used in the pipeline system, focusing on two critical registries:

1. **Step Names Registry** - The centralized registry for all pipeline step names
2. **Hyperparameter Registry** - The centralized registry for hyperparameter configurations

Both registries implement the **Single Source of Truth** design principle, which is foundational to our architecture as described in [Design Principles](../developer_guide/design_principles.md#1-single-source-of-truth).

For an in-depth exploration of how the Step Names Registry is used specifically for consistent step name generation across all components, see [Registry-Based Step Name Generation](registry_based_step_name_generation.md).

## Single Source of Truth Design Principle

The Single Source of Truth principle states that for any significant element in the system:

- Information should be defined exactly once
- There should be a clear owner for that information
- Other components should reference this authoritative source
- Validation should be centralized at the source

This principle is critical for maintaining consistency, reducing errors, and simplifying maintenance across the pipeline system.

## Step Names Registry

### Purpose

The Step Names Registry serves as the single source of truth for step naming across the entire system. It ensures:

1. Consistent naming between configurations, builders, and specifications
2. Prevention of step name collisions
3. Centralized validation of step name references
4. Clear mapping between related components
5. Support for job type variants (e.g., training, calibration) with a standardized naming convention

> **See Also**: [Registry-Based Step Name Generation](registry_based_step_name_generation.md) for detailed information on how the registry ensures consistent step naming across the entire system.

### Structure

The registry is implemented in `src/pipeline_registry/step_names.py` and has the following key components:

#### Core Registry Definition

```python
STEP_NAMES = {
    "StepName": {
        "config_class": "ConfigClassName",
        "builder_step_name": "BuilderClassName",
        "spec_type": "SpecificationType",
        "description": "Description of the step"
    },
    # ... other steps
}
```

Each step has a canonical name as its key, with a dictionary of related components.

#### Derived Mappings

From the core `STEP_NAMES` dictionary, several specialized mappings are derived:

- `CONFIG_STEP_REGISTRY`: Maps config class names to step names
- `BUILDER_STEP_NAMES`: Maps step names to builder class names
- `SPEC_STEP_TYPES`: Maps step names to specification types

#### Helper Functions

The registry provides functions to access and validate information:

- `get_config_class_name`: Retrieve config class name for a step
- `get_builder_step_name`: Retrieve builder step name for a step
- `get_spec_step_type`: Get specification type for a step
- `get_spec_step_type_with_job_type`: Get specification with optional job type
- `validate_step_name`: Check if a step name exists
- `validate_spec_type`: Verify specification type validity
- `list_all_step_info`: Get complete information for all steps

### Integration with Other Components

The Step Names Registry integrates with other components in the following ways:

1. **Type-Aware Configuration Serialization**: Uses the registry to find the correct class for deserialization
2. **Step Builder Creation**: Maps step names to the appropriate builder classes
3. **Step Specification**: References the registry to validate step types and maintain consistent naming
4. **Dependency Resolution**: Validates step names during dependency resolution
5. **Configuration Merging**: Ensures configuration fields are correctly associated with steps
6. **Pipeline Templates**: Provides consistent step naming for pipeline DAG construction
7. **Script Contracts**: Ensures consistency between script contracts and step specifications

For comprehensive details on this integration across all components, refer to the [Registry-Based Step Name Generation](registry_based_step_name_generation.md) document.

### Usage Example

```python
from src.pipeline_registry.step_names import CONFIG_STEP_REGISTRY, get_builder_step_name

# In config field manager - map config class to step name
step_name = CONFIG_STEP_REGISTRY.get(config.__class__.__name__)

# In builder creation - map step name to builder class
builder_class_name = get_builder_step_name(step_name)
```

## Hyperparameter Registry

### Purpose

The Hyperparameter Registry serves as the single source of truth for hyperparameter configurations across all model types. It ensures:

1. Consistent hyperparameter class naming and location
2. Centralized mapping between model types and their hyperparameters
3. Clear module path resolution for dynamic imports
4. Validated access to hyperparameter classes

### Structure

The registry is implemented in `src/pipeline_registry/hyperparameter_registry.py` and has the following key components:

#### Core Registry Definition

```python
HYPERPARAMETER_REGISTRY = {
    "HyperparameterClassName": {
        "class_name": "HyperparameterClassName",
        "module_path": "src.pipeline_steps.hyperparameters_module",
        "model_type": "model_type_identifier",
        "description": "Description of the hyperparameters"
    },
    # ... other hyperparameter classes
}
```

Each hyperparameter class has a unique name as its key, with a dictionary of metadata.

#### Helper Functions

The registry provides functions to access and validate information:

- `get_all_hyperparameter_classes`: List all registered hyperparameter classes
- `get_hyperparameter_class_by_model_type`: Find hyperparameter class for a specific model type
- `get_module_path`: Get module path for dynamic import
- `get_all_hyperparameter_info`: Get complete information for all hyperparameters
- `validate_hyperparameter_class`: Check if a hyperparameter class exists

### Integration with Other Components

The Hyperparameter Registry integrates with other components in the following ways:

1. **Training Steps**: Locate appropriate hyperparameter classes for model training
2. **Configuration Validation**: Validate hyperparameter references in configurations
3. **Model Registry**: Associate models with their corresponding hyperparameter types
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Ensure consistency between tuning jobs and model types

### Usage Example

```python
from src.pipeline_registry.hyperparameter_registry import get_hyperparameter_class_by_model_type, get_module_path

# Get the appropriate hyperparameter class for a model type
hyperparam_class_name = get_hyperparameter_class_by_model_type("xgboost")

# Dynamically import the hyperparameter class
module_path = get_module_path(hyperparam_class_name)
module = importlib.import_module(module_path)
hyperparam_class = getattr(module, hyperparam_class_name)
```

## Best Practices for Registry Usage

### Do's

1. **Always use registry functions**: Never hardcode step names or class names
2. **Add new steps to the registry first**: The registry should be the starting point for new components
3. **Validate references**: Use validation functions to check step names and hyperparameter classes
4. **Use canonical names**: Reference the canonical step names defined in the registry
5. **Keep metadata complete**: Ensure all registry entries have complete metadata

### Don'ts

1. **Don't duplicate registry information**: Never redefine mappings that exist in the registry
2. **Don't bypass the registry**: Don't create ad-hoc mappings between components
3. **Don't hardcode derived information**: Use the registry to look up related information
4. **Don't create parallel registries**: Extend the existing registries instead of creating new ones
5. **Don't modify the registry at runtime**: The registry should be treated as immutable during execution

## Integration with Dependency Resolution

The registries play a crucial role in dependency resolution between pipeline steps:

1. **Step Types**: The Step Names Registry defines valid step types for dependency resolution
2. **Job Type Variants**: Support for job type variants (e.g., training, calibration) in step naming
3. **Hyperparameter Compatibility**: The Hyperparameter Registry ensures compatible hyperparameters for models
4. **Cross-Validation**: Enables validation of dependencies across different step types

## Benefits of Registry Pattern

Implementing the registry pattern for step names and hyperparameters provides several benefits:

1. **Reduced Configuration Errors**: Centralized validation prevents misconfiguration
2. **Enhanced Discoverability**: Easy access to available components
3. **Simplified Maintenance**: Changes can be made in one place and propagated
4. **Clearer Dependencies**: Explicit relationships between components
5. **Self-Documenting**: The registry serves as documentation of available components
6. **Stronger Type Safety**: Validation against a defined set of options

## Conclusion

The Step Names Registry and Hyperparameter Registry embody the Single Source of Truth design principle, providing a centralized point of definition for critical pipeline components. By maintaining these registries and following best practices for their use, we ensure consistency, clarity, and correctness across the pipeline system.

This approach aligns with our broader architectural principles:

- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized definition of key components
- **Explicit Over Implicit**: Clear, explicit relationships between components
- **Type-Safe Specifications**: Validated references to well-defined components
- **Declarative Over Imperative**: Component relationships defined declaratively

By using these registries consistently throughout the system, we create a more maintainable, robust pipeline architecture that can adapt to changing requirements while maintaining internal consistency.
