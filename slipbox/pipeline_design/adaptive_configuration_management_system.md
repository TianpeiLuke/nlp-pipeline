pipeline = AdaptiveConfigSystem.auto_train_xgboost(
    data_source="s3://my-bucket/training-data/",
    target_column="outcome"
)

# System automatically:
# - Analyzes data characteristics
# - Selects optimal hyperparameters
# - Configures appropriate resources
# - Sets up monitoring and logging
```

### Example 2: Guided Interface (Intermediate)
```python
# Guided configuration collection
config_session = AdaptiveConfigSystem.guided_setup()

# Progressive input collection with intelligent suggestions
data_config = config_session.collect_data_configuration()
model_config = config_session.collect_model_configuration()
deployment_config = config_session.collect_deployment_configuration()

# Generate complete pipeline
pipeline = config_session.generate_pipeline()
```

### Example 3: Advanced Interface (Expert)
```python
# Full control with intelligent assistance
builder = AdaptiveConfigSystem.advanced_builder()

# Create configurations with intelligent suggestions
xgb_config = builder.create_xgboost_config()
xgb_config.max_depth = 8  # Override with custom value

recommendations = builder.get_optimization_recommendations(xgb_config)

# Apply selected optimizations
optimized_config = builder.apply_optimizations(xgb_config, recommendations[:3])

# Build pipeline
pipeline = builder.build_pipeline([optimized_config])
```

### Example 4: Backward Compatibility
```python
# Existing configuration classes work unchanged
existing_config = XGBoostTrainingConfig(
    max_depth=6,
    n_estimators=100,
    learning_rate=0.1
)

# Enhance with new capabilities
enhanced_pipeline = AdaptiveConfigSystem.enhance_existing(existing_config)

# Get intelligent recommendations for improvement
suggestions = enhanced_pipeline.get_improvement_suggestions()
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Backward Compatibility Strategy

The Adaptive Configuration Management System maintains full backward compatibility with existing systems:

#### 1. Configuration Class Compatibility
```python
# Existing configuration classes continue to work unchanged
existing_config = XGBoostTrainingConfig(
    max_depth=6,
    n_estimators=100,
    # ... other parameters
)

# New system can process existing configurations
adaptive_system = AdaptiveConfigurationSystem()
enhanced_config = adaptive_system.enhance_existing_configuration(existing_config)
```

#### 2. Step Builder Integration
```python
# Existing step builders work with enhanced configurations
class XGBoostTrainingStepBuilder(StepBuilderBase):
    def __init__(self, config: XGBoostTrainingConfig):
        # No changes needed - same interface
        self.config = config
    
    def create_step(self, **kwargs) -> TrainingStep:
        # Implementation unchanged
        return TrainingStep(...)
```

#### 3. Gradual Migration Path
```python
# Phase 1: Use existing configurations with new intelligence
pipeline = Pipeline.from_existing_configs(existing_configs, enable_intelligence=True)

# Phase 2: Use guided interface with existing step builders
pipeline = Pipeline.guided_setup().use_existing_builders()

# Phase 3: Full adaptive system
pipeline = Pipeline.adaptive_setup(user_level=UserLevel.INTERMEDIATE)
```
