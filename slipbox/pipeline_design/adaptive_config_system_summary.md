    instance_count=1,              # User must determine
    volume_size=30,                # User must calculate
    max_runtime_in_seconds=7200,   # User must estimate
    hyperparameters={              # User must tune
        "max_depth": 6,
        "eta": 0.3,
        "subsample": 0.8,
        # ... 20+ more parameters
    },
    # ... 50+ more configuration fields
)
```

### After: Adaptive Configuration
```python
# Level 1: Declarative (Beginners)
pipeline = Pipeline("fraud_detection").auto_train_xgboost("s3://data/")

# Level 2: Guided (Intermediate)
pipeline = (Pipeline("fraud_detection")
    .guided_setup()
    .with_data("s3://data/")
    .with_target("fraud_label")
    .optimize_for("performance"))  # Only 3-5 essential inputs
