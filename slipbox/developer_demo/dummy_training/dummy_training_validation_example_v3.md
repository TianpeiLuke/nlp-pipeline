## Changes from Previous Validation (V2)

The implementation plan has been thoroughly revised to ensure seamless integration with downstream steps, particularly the packaging step:

1. ✓ **Output Type Compatibility**: Changed output type from `PROCESSING_OUTPUT` to `MODEL_ARTIFACTS` to match the packaging step's dependency type requirement. This modification ensures a 40% boost in the compatibility score calculated by the dependency resolver.

2. ✓ **Logical Name Alignment**: Changed the logical name from `model_output` to `model_input` to exactly match the packaging step's dependency name. This provides both direct logical name compatibility and improved semantic matching.

3. ✓ **Comprehensive Implementation Updates**: All components have been updated to maintain consistency:
   - Script contract's output paths now reference `model_input` instead of `model_output`
   - Step specification uses `model_input` as the logical name and `MODEL_ARTIFACTS` as the output type
   - Builder implementation uses `model_input` in all output references
   - Property path references have been updated to maintain alignment

4. ✓ **Testing Enhancements**: Added a dedicated unit test method `test_output_compatibility_with_packaging` that specifically verifies:
   - The output spec uses the logical name `model_input`
   - The output type is correctly set to `MODEL_ARTIFACTS`
   - ProcessingOutput objects consistently use the name `model_input`

5. ✓ **Integration Strategy Documentation**: Added explicit compatibility enhancement notes in the integration strategy section, highlighting:
   - The use of `MODEL_ARTIFACTS` output type for packaging step compatibility
   - The matching logical name strategy
   - An optional suggestion to add "DummyTraining" to the packaging step's compatible_sources list for additional robustness

6. ✓ **Dependency Resolution Analysis**: The implementation now includes a detailed compatibility analysis showing how these changes will significantly improve dependency resolution:
   - Type compatibility: 40% score contribution
   - Data type compatibility: 20% score contribution
   - Exact logical name match: 25% + 5% bonus score contribution
   - Estimated total score: ~90%, well above the 0.5 threshold

With these comprehensive changes, the DummyTraining step now seamlessly integrates with the packaging step while maintaining all the architectural improvements from the previous version. This demonstrates the importance of considering not just individual component correctness but also cross-component compatibility in pipeline architecture.
