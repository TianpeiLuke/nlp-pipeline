# Pipeline Step Planning Demo

This directory contains demonstration files showing how to use the ML Pipeline Step Planner to create implementation plans for new pipeline steps.

## Contents

- [**Pipeline Step Planner Prompt**](pipeline_step_planner_prompt.md): The prompt template that was used to instruct Claude to act as a Pipeline Step Planner. This prompt outlines the role, context, task, and expected output format.

- **Implementation Plans**:
  - [**DummyTraining Implementation Plan (v1)**](dummy_training_implementation_plan_v1.md): Initial implementation plan for the DummyTraining step.
  - [**DummyTraining Implementation Plan (v2)**](dummy_training_implementation_plan_v2.md): Revised implementation plan that addresses issues identified during validation.
  - [**DummyTraining Implementation Plan (v3)**](dummy_training_implementation_plan_v3.md): Final implementation plan optimized for compatibility with downstream packaging step.

- **Validation Reports**:
  - [**DummyTraining Validation Example (v1)**](dummy_training_validation_example_v1.md): First validation report that identifies issues with the initial implementation plan.
  - [**DummyTraining Validation Example (v2)**](dummy_training_validation_example_v2.md): Second validation report that verifies the revised implementation plan addresses general issues.
  - [**DummyTraining Validation Example (v3)**](dummy_training_validation_example_v3.md): Final validation report confirming compatibility with downstream packaging step.

## Complete Development Workflow

This demo shows how to leverage Claude to create and validate pipeline steps through a comprehensive iterative workflow:

### Planning Phase
1. Start with the prompt template from `pipeline_step_planner_prompt.md`
2. Fill in the specific requirements for your new pipeline step
3. Provide any additional context needed (documentation references, similar examples, etc.)
4. Submit to Claude to generate a comprehensive implementation plan (v1)
5. Use the resulting plan as a guide for developing all required components

### Validation Phase
1. Once the initial implementation plan is ready, use the Validator prompt from `slipbox/v2/developer_prompts/validator_prompt.md`
2. Submit the implementation plan for validation
3. Review the validation report (v1) for issues and recommendations
4. Address any critical or minor issues identified in a revised implementation plan (v2)
5. Submit the revised plan for another validation round
6. Verify that all issues have been addressed in the final validation report (v2)

### Iterative Improvement
This demonstration shows a complete iterative development workflow:
1. **First Iteration**: Initial plan (v1) → Validation (v1) identifies general issues
2. **Second Iteration**: Revised plan (v2) → Validation (v2) confirms general fixes
3. **Final Iteration**: Further revised plan (v3) → Validation (v3) confirms compatibility with downstream steps

## Benefits of the End-to-End Workflow

### Planning Benefits
- **Architectural Consistency**: Ensures new steps follow the established four-layer design pattern
- **Comprehensive Planning**: Covers all components needed for a complete implementation
- **Alignment Verification**: Plans include explicit alignment strategies between layers
- **Error Handling**: Includes considerations for robust error handling and validation
- **Testing Strategy**: Provides a testing and validation approach for the new step

### Validation Benefits
- **Quality Assurance**: Identifies issues before code is committed or deployed
- **Standards Compliance**: Ensures adherence to standardization rules and best practices
- **Educational Tool**: Teaches developers about architectural requirements and expectations
- **Code Improvements**: Provides specific code snippets and recommendations for fixes
- **Objective Scoring**: Gives quantitative feedback on compliance with standards

## Example Structures and Versioning

### Implementation Plan Evolution

The DummyTraining implementation plans show how a plan evolves through iterations:

**Version 1 Plan** follows a structured format that includes:
1. **Step Overview**: Purpose, inputs/outputs, architectural considerations
2. **Components to Create**: Detailed specifications for each required component
3. **Files to Update**: Registry updates and import additions
4. **Integration Strategy**: How the step connects to other pipeline components
5. **Contract-Specification Alignment**: Ensuring proper layer alignment
6. **Error Handling Strategy**: Approach for robust error handling
7. **Testing and Validation Plan**: Strategy for verifying correct implementation

**Version 2 Plan** maintains the same structure but includes key improvements:
1. **Document History**: Tracks changes between versions
2. **Corrected Component Implementations**: Updated code examples with fixes
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Additional validation and error checks
4. **Expanded Testing**: More comprehensive test implementations
5. **Validation Results**: Summary of addressed issues from previous validation

### Validation Report Structure

The validation reports show the progression from issue identification to resolution:

**Version 1 Validation** follows a standardized evaluation format:
1. **Summary**: Overall assessment showing critical and minor issues
2. **Categorical Validations**: Structured checks across 9 validation categories
3. **Detailed Recommendations**: Specific improvement suggestions
4. **Corrected Code Snippets**: Example fixes for identified issues
5. **Standardization Compliance**: Detailed scoring across multiple standards areas

**Version 2 Validation** shows progression to:
1. **Improved Assessment**: Updated from "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT" to "PASS"
2. **Resolved Issues**: Confirmation that previous issues are fixed
3. **Additional Recommendations**: Suggestions for further enhancements
4. **Higher Compliance Score**: Improved scoring across all categories
5. **Change Documentation**: Clear tracking of what changed from v1 to v2

**Version 3 Validation** demonstrates deeper integration compatibility:
1. **Deep Integration Testing**: Validation of compatibility with downstream steps
2. **Cross-Component Analysis**: Evaluation of how components interact across pipeline steps
3. **Full Dependency Resolution**: Verification that the dependency resolver can successfully connect steps
4. **Complete Requirements Fulfillment**: Confirmation that all architectural requirements are met

This versioned approach demonstrates a complete development workflow from initial planning through iterative improvement and final compatibility validation.
