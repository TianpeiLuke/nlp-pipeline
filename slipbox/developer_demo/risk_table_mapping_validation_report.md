## Detailed Recommendations
1. **Error Handling Enhancement**: The `load_json_config` function in the script could differentiate between different types of errors (file not found, permission error, invalid JSON) to provide more specific error messages.
   
2. **Compatible Sources Expansion**: Consider expanding the compatible sources for the `hyperparameters_s3_uri` dependency in the specifications to include more potential upstream providers.
   
3. **Constants Documentation**: The constants `RISK_TABLE_FILENAME` and `HYPERPARAMS_FILENAME` in the script are well-defined, but could benefit from additional comments explaining their significance in the pipeline integration.
   
4. **Testability Enhancement**: The script's modular design with dependency injection points is excellent for testing. Consider adding explicit test cases that verify the hyperparameter override behavior.
   
5. **S3 Path Variable Type Checking**: The S3 path handling in `_prepare_hyperparameters_file` could be enhanced with more explicit type checking, especially for Pipeline Variables.

## Corrected Code Snippets
```python
# Recommendation for src/pipeline_scripts/risk_table_mapping.py:43
# Original:
def load_json_config(config_path):
    """Loads a JSON configuration file."""
    try:
        with open(config_path, "r") as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to load configuration from {config_path}: {str(e)}")
        raise

# Corrected with more specific error handling:
def load_json_config(config_path):
    """Loads a JSON configuration file."""
    try:
        with open(config_path, "r") as file:
            return json.load(file)
    except FileNotFoundError as e:
        logger.error(f"Configuration file not found at {config_path}: {str(e)}")

    except PermissionError as e:
        logger.error(f"Permission denied when accessing configuration at {config_path}: {str(e)}")

## Special Notes

The implementation of the RiskTableMapping step demonstrates excellent design, particularly in:

1. **Hyperparameter Handling**: The approach for handling hyperparameters mirrors the XGBoost training step, providing consistency across the pipeline. The use of internal generation with clear override messaging is exemplary.

2. **Logical Name Consistency**: The alignment between contract logical names and step specification logical names is particularly well-executed, following the change from "config_input" to "hyperparameters_s3_uri".

3. **Constants Usage**: The definition and use of constants (RISK_TABLE_FILENAME, HYPERPARAMS_FILENAME) in the script enhances maintainability and ensures consistency between training and non-training modes.

4. **Error Handling**: The script implements comprehensive error handling with specific exit codes for different error types, enhancing debuggability.

5. **Modular Design**: The separation of concerns in the script's functions makes it highly testable, with clear dependency injection points.

Overall, this implementation can serve as a reference example for future pipeline step development due to its strong alignment with best practices and design principles.
