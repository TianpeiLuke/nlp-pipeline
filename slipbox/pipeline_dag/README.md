# Pipeline DAG

## Overview

The Pipeline DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) module provides the core graph structure representation for pipeline construction. It defines the relationships between pipeline steps and enables automatic dependency resolution and proper step ordering.

## Key Components

### [Pipeline DAG](pipeline_dag.md)

The Pipeline DAG is a fundamental component that represents the structure of a pipeline as a directed acyclic graph. It provides methods for:

- Adding nodes and edges
- Querying dependencies
- Topological sorting
- Cycle detection

## Core Functionality

### Directed Graph Representation

The PipelineDAG provides a lightweight, efficient representation of directed graphs with:
- Fast node and edge insertion
- Constant-time dependency lookups
- Linear-time topological sorting

### Topological Ordering

The PipelineDAG implements Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting, which:
1. Calculates in-degree for each node (number of incoming edges)
2. Identifies source nodes (those with in-degree zero)
3. Processes nodes in a queue, decrementing in-degree of neighboring nodes
4. Detects cycles by checking if all nodes are processed

### Dependency Management

The PipelineDAG supports:
- Forward dependency tracking (which nodes depend on the current node)
- Backward dependency tracking (which nodes the current node depends on)
- Easy traversal in both directions

## Usage with Other Components

### Integration with Pipeline Builder

The PipelineDAG is a core component of the [Pipeline Builder Template](../pipeline_builder/pipeline_builder_template.md). It provides the structure that the template uses to:

1. Define the relationships between steps
2. Determine the order of step instantiation
3. Guide the dependency resolution process

### Integration with Dependency Resolution

The PipelineDAG works in conjunction with the [Dependency Resolver](../pipeline_deps/dependency_resolver.md) to:

1. Define potential dependency relationships
2. Guide message propagation between steps
3. Ensure topologically valid execution order

## Example Usage

```python
# Create an empty DAG
dag = PipelineDAG()

# Data loading and preprocessing branch
dag.add_node("data_loading")
dag.add_node("preprocessing")
dag.add_edge("data_loading", "preprocessing")

# Model training branch
dag.add_node("training")
dag.add_edge("preprocessing", "training")

# Model evaluation branch
dag.add_node("evaluation")
dag.add_edge("training", "evaluation")
dag.add_edge("preprocessing", "evaluation")  # Evaluation also needs raw data

# Model registration branch
dag.add_node("registration")
dag.add_edge("evaluation", "registration")

# Determine build order
build_order = dag.topological_sort()
print(f"Build order: {build_order}")
# Output: ['data_loading', 'preprocessing', 'training', 'evaluation', 'registration']
```

## Best Practices

1. **Step Naming**: Use descriptive names for nodes that reflect their function
2. **Direct Dependencies Only**: Create edges only between steps with direct dependencies
3. **Avoid Redundant Dependencies**: If A→B→C, don't add A→C unless C directly depends on A
4. **Validation**: Always validate the DAG by calling topological_sort() to detect cycles
5. **Modular Construction**: Build complex DAGs by combining smaller sub-graphs
6. **DAG Visualization**: Consider visualizing the DAG for complex pipelines using tools like Graphviz
